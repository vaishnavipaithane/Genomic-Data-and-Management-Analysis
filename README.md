#Genomic Data Management and Analysis

This miniproject is part of 'Fundamentals of Python Programming' virtual internship conducted by Nyberman Bioinformatics, Europe. This project involves data sorting & extraction, data analysis, and data visualization.

##Data Sorting & Extraction:
- Search for fasta files within specified directories and copy them to a new location. This involves identifying fasta files, moving them to a designated folder
- Extract the first line from each fasta file and record it in a text file. This involves reading each fasta file, extracting the first line, and associating it with the corresponding sample name

##Data Analysis:
- Generate details of each folder in a summary CSV file, including the number of files and the list of files present in each folder. This involves traversing through directories, counting files, and compiling a summary report
- Identify the vcf file, read it into a tabular format
- Filter for variants in chromosome 21

##Data Visualization:
- Create a bar chart showing the count of variants on each chromosome. Each chromosome can be represented by a bar, with the height of the bar indicating the total count of variants on that chromosome
